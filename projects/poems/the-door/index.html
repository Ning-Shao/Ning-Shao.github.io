  <h1><em>The Door</em></h1>

  <p class="poem-text">
  Upon the park’s lone bench,<br>
  a philosopher lost in thought;<br>
  Across the street, the silent door,<br>
  her everlasting subject sought.<br><br>

  She is a traveler through time,<br>
  this is the home she has lost;<br>
  Her journeys misplaced the key,<br>
  the years have stolen her right to knock.<br><br>

  Every day she passes that door,<br>
  lifts her hand, then lets it fall;<br>
  Through the imagined slit of curtain,<br>
  she dreams the world concealed within.<br><br>

  She may not part, nor cease to muse,<br>
  until time grows thin,<br>
  and binds her soul within the shade,<br>
  where thought, once living, still remains.

  <h2>Author’s Note</h2>
  <p>
  I wrote <em>The Door</em> after watching <em>Person of Interest</em>.  
  Harold Finch was once the “she” in the poem, the one who sits across the street from Grace’s house, passing her door countless times.  
  He lost his right to knock because his creation, the Machine, placed him and those he loved in danger.  
  He pondered so long that he almost became a ghost.  
  Yet as I revised this story, I realized the poem also mirrors the relation between thought and being, between the human and the eternal, which generations have ceaselessly sought to reach.  
  I wonder—will there ever be a day when the door opens, when humans can travel back and forth through time, and finally embrace the external existence?
